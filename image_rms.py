"""
This is a prototype for a HPC framework for performing 
operations on big-data (FITS images). In this example, 
the operation we choose is the computation of standard 
deviation along xy-planes for all z-values of the data 
cube. The data cube in this example is a FITS image 
with dimension (RA,Dec,Stokes,Frequency). 

* Only FITS images are considered in designing the prototype.
* The prototype does not care about the actual operation to 
  be performed on the data. 
* The prototype provides methods to:
    -- Read user-specified instructions (eg., input data, 
       dimensions across which to perform operations)
    -- Read metadata from the data files
    -- Interpret the meta-data and the user-specified params 
       to decide on the work distribution amongst available 
       processes (CPUs). Let's look at a few possible example 
       cases to illustrate the complexity involved in 
       interpretation:
       ++ Finding the mean of all pixels in the xy-plane for 
          any given z in a FITS image sorted in xyzp order.
       ++ Finding the rms along z-dimension for all pixels in 
          xy-plane in a FITS image sorted in xypz order.
       ++ One of the above with Input FITS image WITHOUT the 
          p-dimension
* perform the desired operation using system functions or 
  user-defined functions.
* Out of scope: Optimising the functions used for the intended 
  operations
* Use cases:
    -- Routine operations requiring data validation and image 
       quality analysis
    -- Pipeline tasks such as image based continuum subtraction. 
       Implementation within non-HPC framework takes 12+ hours 
       for fitting and removing smooth trends (using polynomial 
       fits) for nominal data sizes from ASKAP28.
    -- Post processing of the images: compute rms map, meanMap, 
       spectralIndices
    -- More sophisticated image-processing â€“ RM-synthesis for 
       example.
